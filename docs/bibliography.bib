	abstract = {This article proposes a framework to explore the nature, scope, and content of the evolving topic of Decision Support Systems ({DSS).} The first part of the framework considers (a) three levels of technology which have been designated {DSS}, (b) the developmental approach that is evolving for the creation of a {DSS}, and (c) the roles of several key types of people in the building and use of a {DSS.} The second part develops a descriptive model to access the performance objectives and the capabilities of a {DSS} as viewed by three of the major participants in their continued development and use. The final section outlines several issues in the future growth and development of a {DSS} as a potentially valuable type of information system in organizations.},
