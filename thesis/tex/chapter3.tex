\chapter{SLHS: Subjective Logic in Haskell}

\section{Overview}

In this chapter we introduce our combinator library \emph{SLHS: Subjective Logic
in Haskell}. SLHS is a monadic combinator library for constructing and evaluating
expressions of Subjective Logic. It can be embedded into any existing Haskell
project, and, through Haskell's \emph{Foreign Function Interface}, can be utilized
by other programming languages, most notably $C$ and $C++$.

The following sections are \emph{literate Haskell}, meaning that the same
\LaTeX source used to generate this thesis document can be utilized as a standalone
Haskell module.
