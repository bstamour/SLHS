\chapter{SLHS: Subjective Logic in Haskell}

\section{Overview}

In this chapter we introduce our combinator library \emph{SLHS: Subjective Logic
in Haskell}. SLHS is a monadic combinator library for constructing and evaluating
expressions of Subjective Logic. It can be embedded into any existing Haskell
project, and, through Haskell's \emph{Foreign Function Interface}, can be utilized
by other programming languages, most notably $C$ and $C++$.

The following sections are \emph{literate Haskell}, meaning that the same
\LaTeX source used to generate this thesis document can be utilized as a standalone
Haskell module.

\section{Operators}

In this section we will discuss the implementation details of the Subjective Logic
operators that are provided by SLHS. The following notation is used for the operators:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We denote any binary operators with a trailing exclamation mark $!$ in order to
    avoid conflicting with Haskell's mathematical operators. For example, binomial addition
    is denoted as $+!$
  \item We use tildas as a prefix to denote $co-$ operations. For example, the binomial
    co-multiplication operator is denoted as $\sim *!$
  \item All n-ary operators, where $n > 2$ are denoted as simple functions, instead of
    symbolic operators.
\end{itemize}
