\chapter{SLHS: Subjective Logic in Haskell}


\section{Overview}

In this chapter we introduce our combinator library \emph{SLHS:
  Subjective Logic in Haskell}. SLHS is a monadic combinator library
for constructing and evaluating expressions of Subjective Logic. It
can be embedded into any existing Haskell project, and, through
Haskell's \emph{Foreign Function Interface}, can be utilized by other
programming languages, most notably $C$ and $C++$.


\section{Core Components}

In this section we will introduce components of the library that
are for internal use only. These include the implementation details
for objects such as the \emph{frame of discernment}, \emph{belief
  vectors}, as well as the the type \emph{SLExpr}, which is a monad.
All operators are defined to take and return objects of type
SLExpr, and the monadic interface controls the combination of
sub-expressions.
