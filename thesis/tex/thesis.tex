\begin{uwindoublespaceenv}
Subjective Logic is a recently emergent probabilistic logic system
that allows for reasoning under uncertainty. The fundamental
quantities include opinions based on ownership, beliefs, uncertainty,
and base rates, and a range of operators including logic, fusion and
reasoning over combinations of opinions. Though algebraically
expressive, there is a lack of software tooling to support
computation, such as code libraries, calculators, work benches and, in
particular, software for the development of decision support systems. With this
motivation, we present a complete design for a library of opinion data
structures and operators constructed from higher order functions that
are capable of representing and evaluating arbitrary well-formed
expressions of Subjective Logic.  By leveraging monads, mathematical
objects from Category Theory, we have enabled our operators to
propagate run-time errors from deeply nested sub-expressions and
control the access and updating of state, without sacrificing
compositionality. Furthermore, we have conducted a termination
analysis on the expression evaluator, and a complexity analysis on a
representative subset of the operators. We have also proposed and implemented
extensions to the set of Subjective Logic operators. We have implemented our
library as Subjective Logic in Haskell (SLHS) and provide examples of
how to create and compute the values of Subjective Logic expressions.

\begin{uwindefaultspaceenv}
No worthwhile academic endevour can be done in isolation; the age of the lone genius working
away in his tower are long behind us. Conducting academic research is a team effort, and this
thesis would not have come together without the assistance of some key players. I would first like
to thank my lab mates Paul Preney, Dave MacMillan, and Jeffery Drake for being there to bounce ideas
off of. Especially to Paul: we may have a friendly rivalry when it comes to meta-programming, but you
are by far the better programmer.

I would also like to extend my sincerest thanks to my thesis readers: Dr. Rick Caron from Mathematics and
Statistics, and Dr. Richard Frost from Computer Science. Your comments and suggestions have helped shape
my research in a positive way. Many thanks also go out to my thesis advisor Dr. Robert D. Kent. Bob, thank
you for everything you have done over the years, from the excellent conversations on everything from women
to quantum tunnelling, to the opportunities that you gave me for developing myself both academically and
industrially. Finally, thanks for believing in me even during the times that I had all but given up on myself.

I also wish to acknowledge the love and support of my amazing parents, Gary and Lee Ann St. Amour. Thank you for
always being there for me. I would also like to extend my endless gratitude to my wife, Chelsey St. Amour. I
started the Master's program as your boyfriend, and I'm finishing it as your husband. Words cannot express how
thankful I am of your love and support throughout this adventure.

Finally, I would like to thank the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Auto21 Network of Centres of Excellence for financial support.

Bryan St. Amour was born and raised in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and graduated from F.J. Brennan
Catholic High School in 2005. Bryan completed his undergraduate degree in Computer Science from
the University of Windsor in 2010, and expects to complete his Master's degree in Computer Science
from the same institute in Fall 2014. He currently resides in Tecumseh, Ontario with his wife
Chelsey St. Amour, and their four guinea pigs: Squeakers, Beauty, Scarlet, and Pumpkin.
