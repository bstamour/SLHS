\begin{uwindoublespaceenv}

Subjective Logic is a recently emergent probabilistic logic system
that allows for reasoning under uncertainty. Though algebraically
expressive, there is a lack of software tooling to support computation,
such as code libraries, calculators, and software for the
development of decision support systems. With this motivation, we present a
complete design for a library of opinion data structures and operators constructed
from higher order functions that are capable of representing and evaluating well-formed
expressions of Subjective Logic. By leveraging monads, mathematical objects from
Category Theory, we have enabled our operators to detect and propagate run-time
errors without sacrificing compositionality. Furthermore, we have conducted a termination
analysis on the expression evaluator and a complexity analysis on a representative
subset of the operators. We have also proposed and implemented extensions to the set of
Subjective Logic operators. Lastly, we provide examples of how to compute the values of
Subjective Logic expressions.

    this thesis, I've no doubt you'd be damn proud of me. This thesis
    concerns itself with automated reasoning systems, but there is
    just no reasoning with cancer. Here's to you, kemosabe.}

\begin{uwindefaultspaceenv}
No worthwhile academic endevour can be done in isolation; the age of the lone genius working
away in his tower are long behind us. Conducting academic research is a team effort, and this
thesis would not have come together without the assistance of some key players. I would first like
to thank my lab mates Paul Preney, Dave MacMillan, and Jeffery Drake for being there to bounce ideas
off of. Especially to Paul: we may have a friendly rivalry when it comes to meta-programming, but you
are by far the better programmer.

I would also like to extend my sincerest thanks to my thesis readers: Dr. Rick Caron from Mathematics and
Statistics, and Dr. Richard Frost from Computer Science. Your comments and suggestions have helped shape
my research in a positive way. Many thanks also go out to my thesis advisor Dr. Robert D. Kent. Bob, thank
you for everything you have done over the years, from the excellent conversations on everything from women
to quantum tunnelling, to the opportunities that you gave me for developing myself both academically and
industrially. Finally, thanks for believing in me even during the times that I had all but given up on myself.

I also wish to acknowledge the love and support of my amazing parents, Gary and Lee Ann St. Amour, and to my awesome
sister Kristen. Thank you for
always being there for me. I would also like to extend my endless gratitude to my wife, Chelsey St. Amour. I
started the Master's program as your boyfriend, and I'm finishing it as your husband. Words cannot express how
thankful I am of your love and support throughout this adventure.

Finally, I would like to thank the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Auto21 Network of Centres of Excellence for financial support.
